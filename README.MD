### Pig Game

This project (Pig Game) is a classic two-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The players take turns rolling a six-sided die by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain score, typically 100 points. However, players need to be careful because rolling a "1" on the die will cause them to lose all their current points for that turn!

This repository contains the code and assets for the Pig Game.

## How to Play

Open the game in your web browser by accessing the index.html file.
The game begins with Player 1 rolling the die first.
Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the die and the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6.
If the rolled number is not a "1", the number of points rolled will be added to the player's current score for that turn, displayed in the current score box.
The player can continue rolling the die by clicking the "Roll Dice" button as many times as they wish in one turn, accumulating points each time, until they decide to hold their score.
To hold the score and end their turn, the player must click the "Hold" button. The points accumulated during that turn will be added to the player's total score, displayed in the player's score box.
If a player rolls a "1", all the points accumulated during that turn are lost, and the turn ends automatically, passing to the other player.
The game continues with players taking turns until one of them reaches the winning score.
The first player to reach or exceed the winning score is declared the winner.
